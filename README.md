# Coursework
The core objective of my research project centers on the field of document workflow automation. Specifically, I have concentrated my efforts on the intricate task of extracting entities and facts from information disclosure messages. To achieve this, I harnessed cutting-edge natural language processing and machine learning technologies. The result is an automated system that boasts remarkable accuracy and efficiency in the extraction of essential information components, including company names, addresses, dates, and registration numbers.
One of the primary advantages of my solution lies in its ability to simplify complex document processing workflows, offering a substantial reduction in the time and resources required for this critical task. This enhancement in efficiency inevitably translates into increased overall productivity, making it a valuable tool for organizations dealing with substantial volumes of textual documentation.
Additionally, as a byproduct of the data extraction process, I have compiled a dataset. This dataset has proven instrumental in the realm of financial analysis, enabling the prediction of company stock prices based on the extracted information. This novel application underscores the versatility and practicality of my research outcomes, making them relevant not only to document management but also to the broader field of data-driven decision-making in finance and beyond.
